This is my personal portfolio website.
You can download it for yourself and run it as a react app.
You may need to installs some packages, but they should be automatically included because of the package.json stuff

Currently, this website is more or less at its template stage, since i lack the projects and experience to freshen it up
I do think it looks pretty nice however, so i guess you can have fun with that
